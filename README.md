- 👋 Hi, I’m @Parth-rilkar
- 👀 I’m interested in Coding, programming, database.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python and sql to become a data scientist
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on various project as I want to expand my knowledge and enhance my skills.
- 📫 How to reach me parthrilkar1519@gmail.com
- ⚡ Fun fact: I would love to collect knowledge and information about everything but my interest levels struggle to keep up with my BS so feel free to share your wisdom to me. I think c and c++ and c# are better and more simpler, easier than java's entire lineup!.
